    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Announcement</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Hello everyone, this message is difficult to share. After much thought, I’ve decided to temporarily close BOSS OF COC.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">We’ve constantly had to remind members to complete clan games, capital attacks, war attacks, and donations, but things still haven’t been running as they should. With over 50% players not completing capital attacks and inactive, not completing clan games and war donations it’s become overwhelming and frustrating for me. managing things has become challenging and exhausting.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">Many of you have been loyal, committed, and exceptional players, and I truly appreciate your dedication and the bonds we’ve created together. For those who don’t want to part from the team, I invite you to join #29Y02C80P for CWL this season. The best performer in CWL will be given clan leadership of #29Y02C80P. Also i will be there with Devil's account to talk with you.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">Right now, I need to take a step back. i will be active in-game but i will not manage any clan for now.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">Thank you for your loyalty and understanding. BOSS OF COC will be rebuild soon.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Clan #29Y02C80P will be open on 31st Oct morning and CWL will start on 2nd Nov. Join before start CWL.</p>
