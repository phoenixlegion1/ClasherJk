    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Announcement</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Hello everyone, this message is difficult to share. After much thought, I’ve decided to temporarily close BOSS OF COC.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">We’ve constantly had to remind members to complete clan games, capital attacks, war attacks, and donations, but things still haven’t been running as they should. With over 50% players not completing capital attacks, inactive, not completing clan games and war donations it’s become overwhelming and frustrating for me. managing things has become challenging and exhausting.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">This isn’t a decision I make lightly. Many of you have been loyal, committed, and exceptional players, and I truly appreciate your dedication. It’s because of members like you that I’m confident we’ll come back stronger.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">Right now, I need to take a step back and recharge, so this pause is essential for both my well-being and our clan’s future.</p>

<p class="w3-justify">When we return, we’ll be refreshed, refocused, and ready to rebuild with a stronger, more dedicated team. Thank you for your loyalty and understanding.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">CWL will not be held in BOSS OF COC untill it's rebuild. If you want to play CWL, join #29Y02C80P. CWL will start on November 1st there.</p>
